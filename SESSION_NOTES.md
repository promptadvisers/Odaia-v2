# ODAIA v2 - Session Development Notes

## Session Date: September 17, 2025

### Overview
This session focused on implementing key features for the ODAIA medical configuration platform, including modal dialogs for medical objectives, brand access strategies, and setup card interactions.

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. Medical Objectives Configuration (Commit: a14f036)
**Feature:** Added comprehensive medical objectives management
- Created `MedicalObjectivesDialog` component matching the BOB.png design specifications
- Implemented portfolio products configuration with basket names and scoring weights
- Added therapeutic area and product selection dropdowns
- Integrated indication checkboxes (SEA, EGPA, NP)
- Created IOVIA TRx scoring weights table with baseline/percentile options
- Added expandable sections for Competitive Opportunities and Precursor

### 2. Multi-Card Modal Design Integration (Commit: c70e0cf)
**Feature:** Applied BOB.png modal design to multiple configuration cards
- Renamed `MedicalObjectivesDialog` to `ProjectObjectiveDialog` for multi-purpose use
- Made the dialog context-aware to handle different card types:
  - **Brand Access Strategy:** Shows access-specific metrics (Patient Enrollment Rate, Copay Card Utilization)
  - **Sales Goals:** Displays sales KPIs (XPO TRx Share, NBRx Growth Rate)
  - **Competitive Landscape:** Shows competitive metrics (Market Share vs Competitors)
  - **Medical Objectives:** Original configuration retained
- Dynamic content loading based on card context while maintaining exact UI layout

### 3. Setup Cards Clickable Interface (Commit: 992b6c7)
**Feature:** Made Setup tab cards interactive with detail modals
- Created `SetupDetailDialog` component matching "Setup Preview Detail Modal.png"
- Implemented two-column layout:
  - Left: Suggestions with checklist items
  - Right: Types of Suggestions (Opportunity/Risk sections)
- Made both Setup cards clickable:
  - **Value Engine: HCP Targeting** card
  - **Curation Engine: Call Plan** card
- Added cursor pointer and hover states for better UX
- Card component updated to support onClick and style props

### 4. Approve Button Functionality (Commits: b286948, d9f60f3)
**Feature:** Connected and fixed Approve buttons on Setup cards
- Initial implementation connected buttons to SetupDetailDialog
- Fixed to proper behavior:
  - HCP Targeting Approve → Opens HCPTargetingDialog
  - Call Plan Approve → Opens CallPlanDialog
  - Both maintain consistent behavior with View buttons

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Extended Zustand store with:
  - `editingCardType` state for tracking which card is being edited
  - Support for 'hcp-targeting' and 'call-plan' card types
  - Medical objectives configuration data

### Component Architecture
```
src/
├── dialogs/
│   ├── ProjectObjectiveDialog.tsx (multi-purpose, context-aware)
│   ├── SetupDetailDialog.tsx (quick review interface)
│   ├── HCPTargetingDialog.tsx (detailed HCP configuration)
│   ├── CallPlanDialog.tsx (detailed call plan configuration)
│   └── ...other dialogs
├── screens/
│   └── MainDashboard.tsx (updated with clickable cards)
├── components/
│   └── Card.tsx (updated to support onClick)
└── store/
    └── appStore.ts (extended with new states)
```

### UI/UX Patterns Established
1. **Card Interaction Pattern:**
   - Click card body → Quick review dialog (SetupDetailDialog)
   - Click Approve/View buttons → Detailed configuration dialogs

2. **Modal Hierarchy:**
   - Quick review modals for fast approval
   - Detailed configuration modals for full editing
   - Context-aware modals that adapt content based on card type

3. **Visual Consistency:**
   - All modals maintain consistent styling
   - Orange "Review" badges for status indication
   - Blue primary buttons for main actions
   - Ghost buttons for secondary actions

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Reusable Components:** Created multi-purpose dialogs that adapt based on context rather than duplicating code
2. **Progressive Disclosure:** Two levels of detail (quick review vs full configuration)
3. **Consistent Behavior:** All Setup cards follow the same interaction pattern
4. **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions
5. **State Management:** Centralized state in Zustand for predictable behavior

## Files Modified/Created in This Session

### Created:
- `/src/dialogs/ProjectObjectiveDialog.tsx` (renamed from MedicalObjectivesDialog)
- `/src/dialogs/SetupDetailDialog.tsx`

### Modified:
- `/src/screens/MainDashboard.tsx` - Added clickable cards and new Medical Objectives card
- `/src/App.tsx` - Registered new dialogs and state
- `/src/store/appStore.ts` - Extended with medical objectives and card type states
- `/src/components/Card.tsx` - Added onClick and style prop support

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Medical Objectives card displays correctly
- [x] Edit buttons open appropriate modals
- [x] Setup cards are clickable
- [x] Approve buttons open correct dialogs
- [x] View buttons maintain functionality
- [x] Modal content changes based on context
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] Development server runs without errors

## Known Issues & Future Improvements
1. Consider adding animation transitions between modal states
2. Implement actual save/approve functionality (currently just closes modals)
3. Add form validation for required fields
4. Consider adding loading states for async operations
5. Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility
