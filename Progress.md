## 📝 Known Issues & Considerations

1. **Git Commits**: Changes have NOT been committed regularly during development
2. **Testing**: No automated tests have been written
3. **Documentation**: No inline code documentation added
4. **Performance**: Chat animations and simulations use setTimeout - could be optimized
5. **Responsiveness**: UI is optimized for desktop only

## 🎯 Demo Flow Working

The interactive chat demo now properly:
1. Shows multiple concise prompt options
2. Responds when buttons are clicked
3. Updates configuration in real-time
4. Navigates to Report tab for simulations
5. Completes full workflow as per PRD
